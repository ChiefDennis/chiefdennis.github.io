Hello! I’m Dennis, a cybersecurity engineer with a background in aerospace engineering and a passion for complex technical systems. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s in Aerospace Engineering, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that continue to shape the way I approach technology and security.

Over the years, I’ve worked in environments that blend telecommunications, IT security, and critical infrastructure. These roles have allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Linux systems, networking, cloud architectures, firewalls, IDS/IPS, automation, and secure system design. I’ve also been deeply involved in vulnerability management, patch orchestration, and the development of technical solutions that improve the reliability and security of large-scale operational systems.

To advance my expertise, I completed a Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity, graduating with the highest distinction and earning a 10/10 on my master’s thesis, which focused on cloud security and crypto-agile key orchestration across major cloud providers. This academic work solidified my interest in cryptography, cloud security, and secure infrastructure.

I hold the Microsoft SC-900 certification and am currently pursuing AZ-500 to further strengthen my cloud security capabilities. My technical toolkit spans Python, Bash, PowerShell, cloud services, and a broad range of security tools and methodologies.

Beyond technology, I’m a classically trained pianist with over 15 years of musical education. Music continues to be a meaningful creative outlet and an important part of my life.
