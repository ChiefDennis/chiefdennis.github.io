Hello! I'm Dennis, an Aerospace Engineering graduate who embarked on a journey of exploration and innovation. My academic journey reached new heights when I successfully attained my Aerospace Engineering Degree, marking a significant milestone in my educational pursuit.

I kick-started my professional voyage in the dynamic world of aerospace by contributing my skills and knowledge at Airbus. This invaluable experience laid the groundwork for my current role at Cicomtec Sistemas SL. Here, I find myself immersed in the realm of cutting-edge technology, working with a team that specializes in providing telecommunication devices, including surveillance tools to high-profile clients and special forces.

My responsibilities have afforded me a panoramic view of technology, networking, and Linux operating systems. Engaging in cloud projects, particularly in Microsoft Azure, has become second nature to me. From deploying and configuring virtual machines to orchestrating NSG and firewalls, I thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of IT solutions.

While conquering the tech world, I've also set my sights on the realm of cybersecurity. Armed with the SC-900 Microsoft Certification, I'm currently sharpening my skills for the AZ-500 certification. Beyond certifications, I have my eyes on a future in cybersecurity and am contemplating pursuing a master's degree in the field to deepen my expertise.

Away from the complexities of circuits and codes, I find peace in the enchanting world of classical music. For over 15 years, I've been a devoted pianist, earning accolades for my musical accomplishments. I take immense joy in sharing my passion for music with others and have had the privilege of teaching piano to students of all ages.
